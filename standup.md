So yesterday, I was working on the first half of part 2 of the lab and I was able to make progress and finish most of it. I also finished up part 1 and got a better understanding of what agile was all about.

Today, I'm planning to continue revising it and making sure that it is at least somewhat presentable. I'll be finishing up the rest of the lab by doing the display, sizing, position, pseudo-clas, layouts, responsiveness, and fonts. There are a couple things I'd like to revise and make sure that I have completed before I turn it in.

Lastly, I did not have any blockers in my way.
